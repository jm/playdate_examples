# Playdate examples

Some example scripts for some of the APIs that
don't have SDK examples (at least, not a focused
single file example) currently.

* [qr_code.lua](/qr_code.lua) - How to use the 
QR code generator.
* [lifecycle.lua](/lifecycle.lua) - System lifecycle
function examples.
* [timers.lua](/timers.lua) - Standard timer examples
for each type (e.g., value, key-repeat, etc.).
